  		<h2 id="lun"> Lunch</h2><p>Cannellini beans are a brilliant source of protein, fibre and vitamin C, as well as magnesium – the mineral we need to make our muscles work properly. Fried with fennel seeds until charred and popped, then cooked with the eggs, macerated cherry tomatoes and fresh basil, this is a five-star brekkie or brunch that just happens to be healthy, too. Top with some quality balsamic vinegar or fiery chilli sauce.
